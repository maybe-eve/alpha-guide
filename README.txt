# The Alpha's Guide to the Galaxy

A guide for alpha-clone players in EVE Online.

The guide ([www.thealphasguide.com](https://www.thealphasguide.com)) is built from
Markdown content files using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator,
rendered with a modified version of the [Learn theme](https://matcornic.github.io/hugo-learn-doc/).
