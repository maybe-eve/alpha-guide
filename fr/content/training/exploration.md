If you've chosen to try out exploration further, you'll want to train the following:

### General Scanning Skills

`Astrometric Acquisition` and `Astrometric Rangefinding` make it easier to scan down cosmic signatures. You'll want to train them both to Level II.

Also make sure to train your racial Frigate skill all the way to Level IV, as that will increase the effectiveness of your exploration ship's bonuses.

### Exploration Skills

`Archeology` increases your Virus Coherence ("health") when hacking relic site containers. Training this to Level III will help you successfully complete hacks more often. `Hacking` is the equivalent for data sites, but it's less of a priority since relic sites are the better of the two.
