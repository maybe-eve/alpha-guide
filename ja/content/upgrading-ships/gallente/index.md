キャリアエージェントミッションをこなす中で、エージェントたちは次に挙げる艦船のうちいくつかを支給してくれたことでしょう。 これらの船はあなたが乗っているルーキーシップよりも強力です。 そのうえ性能が特化されていて、それぞれある特定の目的のために作られています。

### フリゲート

フリゲートはニューエデンにおいては最速・最小の部類に属する艦種です。 このために、より大きい船からの攻撃を受けにくいのが特長です。 砲台の追跡速度も同様に高速なので、他のフリゲートと効果的に戦うことができます。 しかし、素の防御力と攻撃力は、他の艦種と比べると弱いです。

##### Atron

The Atron is the Gallente fast-attack frigate. 極めて機動性が高く、十分な火力も備えています。 推進力ジャミングモジュールのキャパシタ消費を削減するボーナスが付いているので、敵の艦船に「タックル」し、その場に釘付けにするのにも適しています。 ただし、防御は比較的薄いです。

[Here is a recommended fit for the Atron.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/atron/)

##### Tristan

The Tristan is the Gallente heavy attack frigate. As a drone platform, it is unrivalled among tech one frigates, capable of fielding a full flight of five light drones, with three spares in its spacious drone bay. It is also fairly well-rounded otherwise, with moderate damage output from its turrets and decent speed and utility options. However, it is somewhat lightly defended.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Tristan.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/tristan/)

##### Incursus

The Incursus is the Gallente heavy combat frigate. Its bonuses to armor repairers let it shrug off a great deal of incoming damage, and it has good firepower and decent utility options. However, it is fairly slow.

##### Imicus

The Imicus is the Gallente exploration frigate. スキャナープローブと遺物/データアナライザーに対して強力なボーナスを持っているので、探検志向のプレイヤーにとっては魅力的な選択肢となっています。 ただし、防御力は弱く、直接戦闘には向いていません。

##### Navitas

The Navitas is the Gallente logistics frigate. It has potent bonuses to remote armor repair modules, allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle. However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Navitas for now.

##### Maulus

The Maulus is the Gallente electronic warfare frigate. It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of sensor dampener modules, allowing it to interfere with the locking speed and range of its enemies' sensors from long range. ただし、防御力は極めて低く、ソロプレイヤーにとって有用な船ではありません。

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Maulus for now.

##### ベンチャー

ベンチャーは採掘用フリゲートで、特定の国家に固有の船ではありません。 採掘レーザーとガス採掘機に対して強力なボーナスを持ち、鉱石ホールドも巨大なため、膨大な量の鉱石を回収することができます。 また、ワープ妨害に対する耐性が組み込まれていて、攻撃者から逃げるのがより容易になっています。 ただし、特に戦闘に適しているわけでもありません。

### 駆逐艦

駆逐艦は対フリゲート用として設計されています。 彼らは「ガラスの大砲」です - フリゲート級の砲台を多数搭載することができ、さらに有効射程と精度を強化するボーナスを備えているため、フリゲートを簡単に、そして瞬く間もなく一掃することができます。 However, their defenses are little stronger than a frigate's, and their larger size and slower speed makes them less able to avoid the fire of larger ships. They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.

##### Catalyst

The Catalyst is one of the Gallente destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets. With the maximum of eight hardpoints for hybrid weapons, and with potent bonuses to their range and accuracy, it will quickly destroy any smaller enemies that come within range of its guns. However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit. Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons' damage output.

[Here is a recommended fit for the Catalyst.](/upgrading-ships/gallente/catalyst/)

##### Algos

The Algos is the other Gallente destroyer, focusing on drones. It gets only five turret hardpoints, few for a destroyer, but has the drone bandwidth to begin mixing in medium drones into its flights, with room in its bay for a spare flight of lights. It also has moderate speed and defenses, and works well with shield-tanking modules.

### Cruisers

Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden. With comfortable slot layouts, decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price, they're the standard by which other ships are measured.

Cruiser fittings will not be provided in this guide. By the time you're getting into a cruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see [Fitting](/reference/fitting/) if you need some pointers.

### Battlecruisers

Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates: much more heavily armed, but substantially slower. Battlecruisers are also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.

The Gnosis is the only battlecruiser available to Alpha clones. It is available to all races, and offers moderate bonuses to nearly all weapons systems and defenses while excelling in none.

A Gnosis fitting will not be provided in this guide. By the time you're getting into a battlecruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see [Fitting](/reference/fitting/) if you need some pointers.

### Industrials

Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden. They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they're armed at all. They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist, or even a combat pilot restocking on gear or moving locations, but are borderline useless in combat and a favorite target of player pirates.

##### Nereus

The Nereus is one of the Gallente industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place. It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks long enough for reinforcements to arrive. However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.
