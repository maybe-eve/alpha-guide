キャリアエージェントミッションをこなす中で、エージェントたちは次に挙げる艦船のうちいくつかを支給してくれたことでしょう。 これらの船はあなたが乗っているルーキーシップよりも強力です。 そのうえ性能が特化されていて、それぞれある特定の目的のために作られています。

### フリゲート

フリゲートはニューエデンにおいては最速・最小の部類に属する艦種です。 このために、より大きい船からの攻撃を受けにくいのが特長です。 砲台の追跡速度も同様に高速なので、他のフリゲートと効果的に戦うことができます。 しかし、素の防御力と攻撃力は、他の艦種と比べると弱いです。

##### Condor

The Condor is the Caldari fast-attack frigate. 極めて機動性が高く、十分な火力も備えています。 推進力ジャミングモジュールのキャパシタ消費を削減するボーナスが付いているので、敵の艦船に「タックル」し、その場に釘付けにするのにも適しています。 ただし、防御は比較的薄いです。

[Here is a recommended fit for the Condor.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/condor/)

##### Kestrel

The Kestrel is the Caldari heavy attack frigate. It gets substantial bonuses to its four missile launchers, allowing it to deal substantial damage in close with rockets or lob light missiles from extreme range. Its good number of midslots also allow it decent defenses or good utility. ただし、機動性はやや悪いです。

[Here is a recommended fit for the Kestrel.](/upgrading-ships/caldari/kestrel/)

##### Merlin

The Merlin is the Caldari heavy combat frigate. It has very powerful shields, and decent firepower and flexibility. However, it is rather slow.

##### Heron

The Heron is the Caldari exploration frigate. スキャナープローブと遺物/データアナライザーに対して強力なボーナスを持っているので、探検志向のプレイヤーにとっては魅力的な選択肢となっています。 ただし、防御力は弱く、直接戦闘には向いていません。

##### Bantam

The Bantam is the Caldari logistics frigate. It has potent bonuses to remote shield booster modules, allowing it to "heal" allied ships in battle. However, it is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Bantam for now.

##### Griffin

The Griffin is the Caldari electronic warfare frigate. It has powerful bonuses to the effectiveness of ECM jammer modules, allowing it to render enemies unable to lock targets and thus helpless to fight back against attackers. However, it is extremely fragile and has little direct combat capability, and is not very useful to a solo pilot.

For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the Griffin for now.

##### ベンチャー

ベンチャーは採掘用フリゲートで、特定の国家に固有の船ではありません。 採掘レーザーとガス採掘機に対して強力なボーナスを持ち、鉱石ホールドも巨大なため、膨大な量の鉱石を回収することができます。 また、ワープ妨害に対する耐性が組み込まれていて、攻撃者から逃げるのがより容易になっています。 ただし、特に戦闘に適しているわけでもありません。

### 駆逐艦

駆逐艦は対フリゲート用として設計されています。 彼らは「ガラスの大砲」です - フリゲート級の砲台を多数搭載することができ、さらに有効射程と精度を強化するボーナスを備えているため、フリゲートを簡単に、そして瞬く間もなく一掃することができます。 However, their defenses are little stronger than a frigate's, and their larger size and slower speed makes them less able to avoid the fire of larger ships. They are also lacking in any utility besides their damage output.

##### Cormorant

The Cormorant is one of the Caldari destroyers, focusing on hybrid turrets. Its seven hardpoints for hybrid weapons have enhanced accuracy and massive boosts to their range, allowing it to reach out and destroy smaller enemies at extreme distance. However, it is very slow compared to frigates, and its size makes it much easier to hit. Additionally, it has very little utility outside of its weapons' damage output.

##### Corax

The Corax is the other Caldari destroyer, focusing on missiles. It has seven launcher hardpoints, and a bonus to missile range and damage application, and comes with a comfortable four midslots, allowing it to mount a strong shield tank. However, it is slow, and its poor CPU and powergrid make it difficult to fit properly.

### Cruisers

Cruisers, as a class, are the most well-rounded ships in New Eden. With comfortable slot layouts, decent firepower, good defenses, moderate speed, and moderate price, they're the standard by which other ships are measured.

Cruiser fittings will not be provided in this guide. By the time you're getting into a cruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see [Fitting](/reference/fitting/) if you need some pointers.

### Battlecruisers

Battlecruisers are to cruisers as destroyers are to frigates: much more heavily armed, but substantially slower. Battlecruisers are also significantly better defended, yet also more expensive.

The Gnosis is the only battlecruiser available to Alpha clones. It is available to all races, and offers moderate bonuses to nearly all weapons systems and defenses while excelling in none.

A Gnosis fitting will not be provided in this guide. By the time you're getting into a battlecruiser, you should be creating fits for yourself; see [Fitting](/reference/fitting/) if you need some pointers.

### Industrials

Industrials, as class, are non-combat ships focused on the transport of goods across New Eden. They have massive cargo holds, but are slow, clumsy, and poorly armed at best - if they're armed at all. They can be a great boon to a marketeer, industrialist, or even a combat pilot restocking on gear or moving locations, but are borderline useless in combat and a favorite target of player pirates.

##### Badger

The Badger is one of the Caldari industrials - a ship line focused on hauling goods from place to place. It has a massive cargo hold, and can mount sufficient defenses to stave off light attacks long enough for reinforcements to arrive. However, it is extremely slow and clumsy, and is borderline useless in combat.
