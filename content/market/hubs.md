While it's technically possible to sell items from any station in EVE, the vast majority
of items are bought and sold at a small set of stations referred to as "market hubs".
These stations will have literally thousands of times more items available than your
average station.

`Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant` is the most popular market hub. It is located in Caldari space.

`Amarr VIII (Oris) - Emperor Family Academy` is also fairly popular, and is located in Amarr space.

`Dodixie IX - Moon 20 - Federation Navy Assembly Plant` is the largest Gallente market hub.

`Rens VI - Moon 8 - Brutor Tribe Treasury` and `Hek VIII - Moon 12 - Boundless Creation Factory` are the largest Minmatar market hubs.

You can visit any of these hubs no matter the race of your character, but your starting system will likely be much
closer to the market hubs in your own race's space.

When traveling to and from a distant trade hub, avoid low-security space. Sometimes the shortest
route is through low security space; make sure your autopilot is set to take the **safest**
route instead. Hostile players often camp the "faster" low-security routes between trade hubs
in hopes of getting easy kills.
