This mission chain walks you through how to use the scanning interfaces
in EVE. Scanning lets you locate things like wormholes, data and relic sites
to hack, and even other players' ships.

The scanning interfaces can be a little hard to understand without seeing
them in operation. Thankfully, EVE has a set of built-in video tutorials
for how to use the scanning interfaces. To view them, press F12 to open
the "Help" window, then select the "Tutorial Videos" tab. Scroll down to
the "Exploration" subsection (click to expand it). Then watch the following
videos:

 * Scanning (1 of 3)
 * Scanning (2 of 3)
 * Hacking Data and Relic sites

The other videos are also interesting, but aren't relevant to this particular
mission chain - feel free to watch them when you have the time and interest.

You can also look through our [scanning guide](/reference/scanning/) if you prefer a text format.

As you complete the chain, you'll earn a couple of new ships (including one
specifically designed for exploration), some skill books, some modules,
and a good chunk of ISK.

#### Common Stumbling Blocks

 * On mission 3 of 5, you'll be required to find a "Data Site".
   This is a Cosmic Signature, and you will not be able to warp to it without using scanner probes.
   Review the Scanning (2 or 3) video to learn how to use these probes to find the site.
 * On mission 5 of 5, you'll need a Passkey with you to be able to enter the final site.
   It's provided to you when you begin the mission; remember to put it in your cargohold before you undock.
