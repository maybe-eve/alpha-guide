While it is certainly possible to play EVE alone, it's generally a lot more fun
to have a group of other people who share your interests. Joining a corporation
will give you many more options than you'd have flying alone.

### Starter NPC Corps

You start the game in one of these, automatically assigned based on how you created
your character - your race and bloodline. If you ever join a different corp and then
quit it later, you'll be placed back into another NPC corp based on your race.

All NPC corps have a built-in tax rate of 10%. That means any mission rewards you earn
will be charged a 10% fee.

### Factional Warfare NPC Corps

Faction Warfare (FW) allows you to sign up to PvP for your race's empire in low-sec
space: Amarr vs. Minmatar and Caldari vs. Gallente. There are two ways of getting into
faction warfare - you can either join the empire's FW NPC corp, or you can find a
player-run corp that participates in faction warfare.

For more details about Faction Warfare, see the [UniWiki Factional Warfare guide]
(http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Factional Warfare).

### Player-run Corps

Players can create their own corporations (and in fact the majority of corporations
in EVE are player-created). These corporations can set their own tax rates, declare
war against one another, conquer parts of null-security space, and more.

Don't accept random corp invitations - the average quality of a corporation that invites
players randomly out of the blue is very low. Instead, look for a corporation that
is dedicated to doing what you're interested in doing and ask about recruitment.

[EVE University](http://www.eveuniversity.org/) is a well-known player corp in
EVE that is devoted to teaching new players. There are many other player-run corps
as well. We recommend the following resources for finding a corporation that suits
your interests:

 * The [Recruitment Center](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=topics&f=265)
   on the official forums
 * The [r/evejobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/) subreddit 
 * [This blog post](https://mikeazariah.wordpress.com/2016/11/17/ooc-joining-the-gang/)

There are a handful of large nullsec corps that recruit rather freely
amongst new players and often organize group content in nullsec space: 
[Brave Newbies](http://www.bravecollective.com/),
[Karmafleet](https://recruit.karmafleet.org/),
[Pandemic Horde](https://www.reddit.com/r/pandemichorde/),
and [Dreddit](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/).

It's okay to take your time finding a corporation that suits your interests. It's also
okay to change your mind if you join a corporation and find that you don't like it.

{{% notice warning %}}
Remember that once you trade items, send someone isk or give anything else away they
can do whatever they want with it. Be wary if a recruiter asks for a fee to join
their corporation or offers to move your items. It might be a scam.

You can leave a corp that you've joined by right-clicking on your own name and choosing
<kbd>Quit Corporation?</kbd> > <kbd>Confirm Quit Corporation</kbd>. Doing so will place
you back into an NPC corp based on your race.
