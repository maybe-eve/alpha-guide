### What

Mining involves harvesting resources from asteroids, either in asteroid belts
or special mining signatures located via scanning.

### How

If you decide to pursue mining as a source of income, you'll probably want
to use a Venture, as it is the best dedicated mining ship you have available
as an alpha clone. Its 5000 m^3 Ore Hold allows it to store a significant
amount of ore so that you don't have to return to a station to drop off
your ore quite as often.

It's relatievly easy to sell the ore you mine, though the profits may be relatively
low for highsec miners. Mining in lower security space can increase profits but also
increases the level of risk, as players may frequently try to attack you.

You can read more about mining in the [UniWiki 'Mining' article](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mining).

### Why

Mining is probably the most sedate of all EVE income opportunities - once
your mining lasers are activated on an asteroid, it's mostly just waiting
for the raw ore to come streaming in. If you're mostly interested in socializing
with other players, it can be a great activity to do while socializing.
