This guide is designed to help alpha clone players quickly ramp up their competency in EVE Online.

While we can't make you an expert overnight, we can start you out on the right foot and help you
grasp the things that the tutorial might not cover, or cover them in more detail.

This guide isn't comprehensive. There are many other excellent resources out there that provide
broader knowledge about EVE Online, and parts of this guide may link to them as well. However,
this guide in particular aims to address the specific needs of alpha clone capsuleers.
