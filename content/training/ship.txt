Nearly everyone will want to train their race's Frigate skill up to at least
Level III, as this both improves the effectiveness of their frigate's ship bonuses
and also unlocks additional classes of ships for training.

If the path you've chosen involves flying frigates a lot, you'll probably want
to go a bit further and train the skill to Level IV to further improve your
ship bonuses.

If the path you've chosen involves upgrading to higher classes of ships, you'll
probably want to start training towards cruisers.
