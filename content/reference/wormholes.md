You've just scanned down a wormhole for the first time, and you're sitting next to it
in space, wondering... "should I jump in?" You may have heard that wormholes are
dangerous places, but perhaps you've also heard that they contain lucrative exploration sites.

Both of these are true - wormholes definitely hold to the maxim of "nothing risked, nothing
gained." So this guide is going to walk you through the basics of going on the adventure
that is entering wormhole space. This is not a complete guide to everything wormholes -
for that, you'll probably want to look at the
[UniWiki 'Wormholes' article](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes).
This is just enough that you can hopefully have an interesting trip without making
avoidable rookie mistakes.

### What ship should I take into a wormhole?

You're going to want to be in an exploration frigate for your first trip into a wormhole.
Chances are you're already in one (that's probably what you scanned it in), but if you're
not, we recommend switching to one. Wormholes involve a bunch of scanning once you're
inside them as well, so you want to be in the right ship for the job.

Not sure what your race's exploration frigate is? Check the [Upgrade to a New Ship](/upgrading-ships/)
chapter. The recommended exploration frigate fits there are suitable for wormhole exploration.

Whatever fit you're using, you want to make sure you have at least 3 things fit and loaded:

 * 1x `Core Probe Launcher I` or another probe launcher.
 * 8x `Core Scanner Probe I` or some other core probe variety.
 * 1x `Relic Analyzer I` (Relic sites are what you're looking for to make ISK.)`

Bringing spare probes is not a bad idea, but also by no means required.

### Which wormhole should I enter?

You can determine some information about a wormhole without ever jumping through it.
After you've warped to the wormhole, right-click on it and choose Show Info. The
description window that pops up will tell you **four important things to know**.

#### Where does it lead?

The first is the kind of space on the other side of the wormhole. You can tell this
from the line of the description that begins with _This wormhole seems to lead into..._

If it says it leads to "high", "low", or "null" security space, the other side is a regular
highsec, lowsec, or nullsec system somewhere else in the known galaxy. This is not what you
are looking for (though you could certainly try peeking through it to see where it leads).

If it says it leads "into _dangerous_ unknown parts of space" or "into _deadly_ unknown
parts of space", the other side is a Class 4 or higher wormhole. These are also not what
you are looking for because any relic sites in them will have sleeper enemies defending them.

If it says only that it leads _"into unknown parts of space"_ you've found what you're looking
for - this wormhole leads into a Class 1, 2, or 3 wormhole which is where the relic sites
you're looking for can spawn.

#### Is it about to time out?

Wormholes, unlike stargates, come and go. A wormhole generally doesn't last for more than 24
hours from when it initially spawned. The thing you want to look for here is whether or not
the wormhole description mentions that it is **"nearing the end of its natural lifetime."**

If you see that in the description, the wormhole could disappear at any moment. If you don't
see that in the description (even if the description talks about decay), the wormhole has at
least a couple of hours remaining before it goes end-of-life ("EOL") and times out.

_Only enter wormholes that are not end-of-life._

#### Is it about to destabilize?

In addition to their time limit, wormholes also have a limit on how much total ship mass can
pass through them before they destabilize and disappear. The description on the wormhole will
have one of three phrases which indicate how close they are to destabilizing.

If the description states that the wormhole is **"on the verge of collapse"**, the wormhole
has less than 10% of its mass limit remaining and may disappear at any time. This is generally
referred to as a "crit hole". You want to avoid entering these holes.

If it states that the wormhole _"has had its stability reduced, but not to a critical degree"_
then the wormhole has somewhere between 10-50% of its mass limit remaining. Be wary of entering
these wormholes because the reduced state indicates that there's been a fair amount of other
traffic through the hole.

The thing you want to find is a wormhole that _"has not yet had its stability disrupted"_.
Wormholes with this in the description have 50% or more of their mass limit remaining and
so are unlikely to destabilize of natural causes any time soon.

_Only enter wormholes that have plenty of mass remaining._

#### What size of ships does it allow?

Some wormholes have limits on the size of ships that can pass through them. Since you're
in a frigate, you can go through any wormhole, but it can sometimes be useful to know
what kinds of other ships could also go through. This is a little less important though.

If the wormhole says that _"only the smallest ships"_ can pass through, then only ships
with the mass of a destroyer or frigate can go through.

_"Up to medium size ships"_ means anything battlecruiser-sized or smaller. _"Larger ships"_
means anything battleship-sized or smaller, and _"Very large ships"_ means nearly every
kind of ship can go through it.

_Small wormholes are good for you, since fewer other players' ships can go through them._

### Okay, let's go!

Now that you've checked that this is a good wormhole to enter, it's time to begin the
expedition.

**First things first:** right-click the wormhole and select Save Location... to make
a bookmark for the entrance. Name it whatever you'd like. It'll show up in People &
Places (<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>E</kbd>) in the Places tab, and also when you right-click
in empty space.

Open your Directional Scanner window (<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>D</kbd>) and make sure that
both the Range and Angle sliders are set full right (the Angle should read 360). In
Wormholes your d-scan will be your best friend for staying safe. Inside wormholes,
players don't show up in the Local channel member list unless they say something (and
they won't). So d-scan will be your only warning of players in the system before they
appear next to you.

You're about to enter the wormhole. Read through the next few steps first so you're
ready to do them together without having to look back at this guide.
{{% /notice %}}

Right-click the wormhole and select Enter Wormhole. Your ship will jump through
the wormhole to the other side.

When you load into the system on the other side of the wormhole, **don't move yet**.
Like jumping through a stargate, going through a wormhole gives you 60 seconds
of automatic cloaking so that you can get your bearings. (The timer appears in
the upper left corner as a circled blue ship.)

While you're still cloaked, right-click on this side of the wormhole and bookmark
it as well. If you don't bookmark it you'll have to scan it down again later to
find your way back out, with no way of knowing for sure if it's the same wormhole.

Now, still not breaking your cloak, press the Scan button on your d-scan window to
refresh the results. Hopefully you won't see much aside from celestials like planets
and customs offices. **If you see any ships or probes on d-scan, go back through the
wormhole.** You're in a scanning frigate, and you're not looking for a fight.

At this point your 60 seconds of jump cloak is probably about to expire. It's time
to make a safe spot. Right-click in space and go to the Planets menu, then pick a
random planet from the list and warp to it. As you're starting to warp, press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd> to bring up the bookmark creation screen, and type
in a name like "mid safe". **While in the middle of your warp, press the Save button.**
This will create a bookmark in a spot in empty space somewhere between the wormhole
and the planet you warped to.

{{% notice note %}}
Bookmarks created via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd> are located where you were when
you pressed Save, **not** where you were when you opened the window.
{{% /notice %}}

Once you've landed at the planet, right-click in empty space and warp back to you
mid safe bookmark. When you land there, press the Scan button on your d-scan again
to make sure there still aren't any ships or probes on scan. If anything has appeared,
warp back to the wormhole exit you bookmarked earlier and leave.

_(If you were reading ahead before, this is probably where you can go ahead and
do the things mentioned above.)_

Since as an alpha clone you can't use a cloaking device, this mid safe (and others
you create like it) is your best defense against hostiles in a wormhole. Players
that want to locate you will have to use combat probes to scan you down. By frequently
refreshing d-scan, you can spot these probes and leave before they get a chance to
attack you.

{{% notice tip %}}
Try to keep refreshing d-scan every 10-15 seconds. Experienced players can probe a
ship down in 15 seconds or less and will recall their probes once they've finished.
You can bind refreshing d-scan to a key in the Esc menu to make it easier to refresh.

{{% notice note %}}
If you're jumping into a wormhole directly from highsec, there's another option:
instead of creating a safespot, you can do your scanning from directly on the
wormhole exit itself. If another ship shows up, you just jump back to highsec.
{{% /notice %}}

Now it's time to launch your own probes to start scanning the signatures in the system.
Note that your own probes will appear on your d-scan listing, so don't be spooked by
probes that belong to yourself - but make sure to watch for any additional sets of probes
that might appear.

### What am I looking for?

Since you already had to scan down the entrance wormhole, this guide won't cover
how to scan down a signature. Instead, let's talk about what you're looking for.
Amongst all of the signatures in the system, you're looking for the **relic** sites.
In particular, you're looking for a very specific kind of relic site, the ones
with a pirate faction in the name.

There are two kinds of relic sites in Class 1-3 wormholes: faction and sleeper.
Sleeper relic sites have sleeper enemies in them; you don't want those because
you can't fight sleepers. Faction relic sites have no NPC enemies - they're just
like relic sites in normal space.

Faction relic sites have a faction in the site name: **Sansha,
Guristas, Serpentis, Angels, Blood**. Sleeper relic sites have words like "Unsecured", "Perimeter", or "Sleeper" in
the name.

### I found a faction relic site, now what?

Assuming d-scan is still clear, warp to it and start hacking! Continue to keep an eye
on (and refresh) d-scan as you're hacking, and if you see anything new show up make
sure to warp out back to either your mid safe or the wormhole exit. If everything
goes well you should loot some salvage from each of the cans you successfully hack.

Once you've finished the site you can warp back to your mid safe and keep scanning,
or exit the wormhole with your newly acquired loot.

For your first wormhole expedition I recommend leaving once you've either finished
all of the relic sites or have at least 20M worth of loot, but it's up to you how
long you want to stay. Do note that scanner probes will expire if you leave them
in space for longer than an hour, so if they've been out for a while you'll want
to recall them and re-launch to refresh their expiry timer.

### I did it!

Congratulations on completing your first wormhole expedition! The salvage you've
acquired is generally fairly easy to sell in a [market hub](/market/hubs/) - the
buy orders are usually pretty good there. If you happen to have an extrodinarily
large amount of valuable salvage in your cargohold (40M or more) make sure to be
extra careful on your way to the trade hub to avoid getting suicide ganked - don't
autopilot and don't go AFK or sit still on gates. Once you reach the market hub,
sell your loot and enjoy the ISK!
